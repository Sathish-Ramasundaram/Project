Be thankful for what you have:
Some people aren't as fortunate as you.
Some people are missing organs that you have.

Health is Wealth: 
As long as your body is healthy, you have thousands of problems. But the moment your body gets sick, you have only one problem. 

That's why, before tackling everything else or figuring out how to build your life, make sure your body stays healthy. So, respect, take care of, love, and nourish your body. Give your body top priority.

Control Is Needed
Scratching an itch may feel good in the moment, but it often makes the problem worse—turning a minor irritation into an inflamed wound. What seems like relief can actually deepen the damage. This simple act reminds us that not all impulses deserve action. True control lies in resisting short-term comfort to protect long-term well-being.

The Procrastination Paradox:
When we have tasks with deadlines, even if we tend to procrastinate, we usually end up completing them at the last moment, often in a messy manner. This happens with school projects or work assignments. However, when it comes to personal growth activities, which lack deadlines, procrastination often means we never complete them. Examples include getting physically fit or learning new technology. 

To solve this paradox, we must first accept that our biggest projects are built on the smallest actions. Start by creating a personal deadline for yourself. Then, break down your goal into tiny, almost minimal steps—tasks so minor they feel impossible to ignore.
For example, if your goal is to learn a new programming language, your daily task could be to write just three lines of code. If you want to get in shape, start by doing just five push-ups. Do these small actions every single day. The consistent habit, not the dramatic effort, is what truly leads to progress.

- Said by Tim Urban in a TED Talk.


Communication:
Your words create your world:
Be careful what you say, because once words are out, they cannot be taken back. A single insult or wrong word can cause lasting harm. You can apologize, but it will never erase what was said; the person affected will still remember.

Beyond how words affect others, using them wisely can also shape your own mindset. If you choose to think and say, “I can do it. I’m confident, calm, and ready,” that’s the reality you’ll create.

Guidelines for Effective Communication:
Some people do not complete the sentences they begin to speak. This should be avoided, and we should ensure that we finish our sentences. 

Additionally, we should listen carefully to what the other person says and respond with a precise reply. Always focus on the positive side when speaking; if we need to express something negative, try to rephrase it with a positive tone. Thinking is very important—always consider how your words might make the other person feel before speaking. This practice contributes to meaningful conversation.

Reading Aloud: The Bridge to Fluent Speech:
I’ve learned that reading aloud is a powerful practice for improving spoken communication. While silent reading helps us absorb ideas and expand vocabulary, it doesn’t always prepare us for real conversations — such as interviews or discussions — where pronunciation and word recall matter.

Often, we struggle to pronounce certain words correctly, find the right words naturally, or complete sentences while speaking. To overcome this challenge, reading aloud trains our tongue, voice, and memory together. It builds fluency, confidence, and clarity — making our speech more expressive and effortless.

So, if we want to speak well, we must read aloud regularly. It’s not just a habit — it’s a bridge between knowing and expressing.

How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything
The way you show up for loved ones. 
The way you treat strangers. 
The way you organize your space. 
The way you care for your body. 
The way you nurture your mind. 
Even the way you make your bed in the morning.

None of these actions is isolated. Each one reflects your deeper values and habits. Because how you do one thing—no matter how small—eventually shapes how you do everything.


Do not take the situation personally. Act like a witness:
If you are going to buy a house that you like the most, but the seller is demanding more than your budget, you may feel anxiety, fear of losing, and distress while you are negotiating
This happens because you are attached to the outcome.

But if you are with your friend who is buying the property. When you are negotiating with the seller on behalf of your friend, you will feel relaxed, calm, and full of energy. 
This is because you don’t worry about the result. Whether you win or lose, it doesn’t affect you. In that situation, you have your full energy.

The Power of Small Steps:
Arokiaswamy Velumani was once asked how he managed to build a successful business in North India, despite being a person from the South.
He replied with a story:
He asked the questioner, “Can you lift a cow?” / He asked the questioner if he could lift a cow.
The questioner said, “No, I can't.” / The questioner said he could not.
Then Velumani said, “I can.” and went on to explain the trick. / Then Velumani said he could and went on to explain the trick.

He asked again, “Can you lift a newborn calf?” / He asked the questioner again if he could lift a newborn calf.
The questioner said, “Yes, I can.” / The questioner said that he could.
Velumani explained, “If you lift that calf every day as it grows, you will eventually be able to lift the fully grown cow.” / Velumani explained that if he lifted that calf every day as it grew, he would eventually be able to lift the fully grown cow.

He related this to his own journey. When he moved to North India, he started with a first standard Hindi book. After completing that, he moved on to the second standard book, and so on.

The lesson: Success comes by starting from the basics and moving step by step to the advanced level.
It’s a natural process that happens without sudden, drastic changes. 


The Present Moment is Life: 
Life unfolds one day at a time. You are born in a day, you live in a day, and you die in a day. 
Everything happens in the present moment. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow is uncertain—what you truly have is today. That’s why joy must be found in each day, not postponed for next year or some distant future. Don’t say, “I want a happy life.” Say, “I want a happy day.” Because when you create many happy days, you’ve already built a happy life.


Stress doesn’t come from hard work. It primarily comes from not taking action on something you actually have some control over. Stress arises when you ignore things you shouldn’t be ignoring. 
Jeff Bezos. 


A Joke:
A train was running on the track. Beside the track, there were paddy fields. Suddenly, the train left the track and went into one of the fields, and then came back onto the track.
The passengers were angry with the driver. They rushed to his cabin and asked,
“Why did you take the train off the track into the field?”
The driver replied,
“A person was lying on the track.”
The passengers shouted furiously,
“So, to save one person, you risked all our lives? You should have just run him over with the train!”
The driver calmly answered,
“I actually tried to. But when the train got close, he ran off the track and into the field. So, I turned the train into the field and killed him there. Now, we’re back on track.”
Chitti Babu. 


A Joke with a Moral:
At a wedding ceremony, the couple asked the photographer to keep taking photos of every moment without giving him a break to eat or even drink a glass of water.

They warned, “If you take a break, you won’t get paid.” / They warned that if he took a break, he would not get paid.

Upset by this kind of treatment, the photographer quietly kept clicking photos until the ceremony ended. Then, he deleted all of them.
Moral: Respect the people who work for you.

The Farmer and the Creeper:
Once there was a farmer who noticed a small creeper growing near his crop field. He thought, “It’s tiny, it won’t harm my crops,” and ignored it.
Days passed, and the creeper grew stronger. It slowly wrapped around the crops, stealing their nutrients and blocking the sunlight. By the time the farmer realized its impact, the creeper had already weakened the entire field.
The farmer sighed, “If only I had removed it when it was small, it would have been easy.”

Moral: Bad habits are like that creeper. Easy to ignore when small, but once they grow, they are hard to remove and can destroy much of what we value.

“Habits start as cobwebs and end as chains.”

“Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.” — Warren Buffett

“First we make our habits, then our habits make us.” — John Dryden


Box-and-tick method:
Often, we avoid tasks we dislike—even when we know they are valuable for our growth. The real struggle is usually taking that first step.
To overcome this, use the box-and-tick method.
For example, if your goal is to do 30 push-ups, break it into smaller milestones: 10, 15, 25, and 30. Each time you reach a milestone, tick the box. That small action gives your brain a sense of reward and motivates you to keep going.
This works just as well for studying. If you want to study for a set period, create boxes for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so on. After completing each interval, tick the box and enjoy the sense of progress.
By breaking big tasks into smaller, trackable steps, you turn effort into achievement and make discipline feel more rewarding.

The Carpenter's Procrastination:
Elias, a master carpenter, was known throughout the valley for his exquisite craftsmanship. His furniture was more than just wood and nails; it was a work of art. But for all his talent, Elias had one crippling flaw: he was a world-class procrastinator.

One day, he received a commission from the queen herself: to build a royal banquet table. The table had to be ready for the Summer Solstice festival, which was exactly a month away. Elias, confident in his abilities, thought, "A month is plenty of time. I will start tomorrow."

"Tomorrow" came and went, as did the next day. The sun rose and set, and Elias found a new reason each morning to put off the work. "I will start after I finish sharpening my chisels." "I will start after I organize my wood." "I will start after I take a long lunch."

Soon, a week had passed. Then two. The queen’s messenger arrived, asking for a progress update. Elias, looking at his untouched workshop, simply said, “Almost done.” The truth was, he had yet to cut a single piece of wood.

With only a few days remaining, a wave of panic washed over him. The vision of the grand table, which had been so clear in his mind, was now a source of terror. He worked frantically, his hands shaking, his mind racing. He cut corners, glued pieces that should have been joined with careful dovetails, and used a fast-drying varnish that left a cheap, plastic-like finish.

The day of the festival arrived. Elias delivered the table, his heart heavy with shame. It was a table, to be sure, but it was a clumsy, uninspired piece of work. The queen, a woman of discerning taste, saw its flaws immediately. The royal commission was not only a failure but a public embarrassment.

Elias returned to his workshop, defeated. He looked at the tools of his trade, which had been so neglected, and a simple truth dawned on him. The masterpiece wasn't in the finished product; it was in the daily work, the small tasks of sanding, shaping, and joining.

From that day forward, he lived by a new rule: do today's part of the task. When a new project arrived, he would take one simple action, no matter how small. He would cut the first piece of wood, sand one plank, or sharpen his tools. He learned that a single, purposeful step taken today prevents a frantic, disastrous rush tomorrow. His new masterpieces were born not from grand gestures, but from the simple, consistent effort of each day.

Teaching with Empathy, Patience, and Purpose:
As an educator, it is essential to foster a learning environment where every student feels valued and supported. Avoid statements such as, “I believe the previous faculty covered this topic,” or “I hope you’re already familiar with the basics, so I’ll proceed.” Remarks like these can unintentionally isolate students who may not share the same background knowledge, leaving them reluctant to ask questions or fully participate.

Instead, approach each lesson with inclusivity and a commitment to guiding all learners toward success. This means being prepared to reinforce foundational concepts, creating space for questions, and showing students that their growth is your highest priority.

Empathy: Build a safe and inclusive classroom by never assuming prior knowledge. Be willing to revisit fundamental material, demonstrating that every student’s understanding matters.

Patience: Teach at a thoughtful pace, allowing time for reflection and deeper comprehension of complex ideas.

Comprehension: Strive for clarity and mastery. When students truly grasp the material, a simple lecture transforms into meaningful and lasting learning.

Teaching with empathy, patience, and purpose not only enhances academic achievement but also inspires confidence, curiosity, and a lifelong love of learning.


Warren Buffett’s Quotes:
The best investment you can make is in your own abilities. Anything you invest in yourself will pay back tenfold.

It’s better to spend time with people who are better than you. Choose associates whose behavior is superior to yours, and you will drift in that direction.

Do not save what is left after spending; instead, spend what is left after saving.

It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.

Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree long ago.

It’s good to learn from your mistakes. It’s better to learn from other people’s mistakes.

Price is what you pay; value is what you get.

There comes a time when you should start doing what you truly want. Take a job you love, and you’ll jump out of bed in the morning.

Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.

The more you learn, the more you earn. 

The True Path to a Happy Life:
As young people, we are often led to believe that a happy life is defined by material success—earning more money or achieving fame. However, decades of scientific research, like the Harvard Study of Adult Development led by psychiatrist Robert J. Waldinger, reveal a different truth.

The study, which has tracked participants for over 80 years, consistently shows that it is not wealth or accolades that lead to happiness and good health, but strong, warm relationships. Our connections with family, friends, and community are the most significant predictors of a long and fulfilling life.

Therefore, the key to lasting happiness lies in where you invest your time and energy. Prioritize good people and cultivate meaningful relationships, while actively avoiding toxic ones. By nurturing these bonds, you are building the true foundation for a happy and healthy life.

The Power of Solitude:
In today’s world, schools and workplaces often favor extroverts through activities like group study, collaborative assignments, and constant team meetings. While these social interactions are valuable and necessary, this focus can sometimes overshadow the equally important practice of working alone. 

In earlier times, there was a greater appreciation for quiet, analytical thinking and deep focus—the kind of work that happens in solitude.

Independent thinking, deep analysis, and focused effort are essential for personal growth and meaningful contribution. Both extroverts and introverts need space to thrive, both personally and within their communities.

To achieve this balance, we must recognize the power of our own inner world. The solution is to honor your natural strengths and confidently pursue the solitary work you feel drawn to. By dedicating time to independent thought and focused effort, we can reclaim the space needed for deep, meaningful growth and unlock our full potential.

This insight comes from Susan Cain’s TED Talk.

From the book called "The Power of Habit". 
The book's core argument is that habits are not just a single action, but a three-step cycle that the brain follows.
The Habit Loop
Cue: This is the trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. It could be a time of day, a location, a specific person, an emotion, or the preceding action in a sequence.
Routine: This is the physical, mental, or emotional behavior that follows the cue. It's the habit itself.
Reward: This is the positive outcome that your brain gets from completing the routine. The reward helps the brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.
Your application of the concept is perfect.

To change a habit, you shouldn't try to eliminate the cue or the reward, because those are deeply ingrained in your brain. Instead, the most effective strategy is to keep the Cue and the Reward the same, but insert a new, more positive Routine.

Here is an example to illustrate this:
Original (Bad) Habit:
Cue: Feeling bored and tired.
Routine: Scrolling through videos.
Reward: Feeling occupied (even though it's a waste of time).

New (Good) Habit:
Cue: Feeling bored and tired (same as before).
Routine: Read or write books (the new, positive action).
Reward: Feeling occupied and productive (same reward, but with a different feeling attached).
By making this small but crucial change to the routine, you get the same sense of satisfaction and occupation that your brain craves, but you've replaced a negative habit with a positive one. It's a powerful way to make lasting change.

Fitness Begins Before the Workout:
We often see people heading to the gym—motivated, dressed for fitness, ready to train. Yet when the gym is on the first or second floor, many choose the elevator over the stairs. That moment made us pause.

If we avoid even a few steps, how do we expect to build lasting fitness?
True fitness isn’t just about lifting weights or running miles. It’s about choosing movement over convenience, even in the smallest moments. It’s about being active when it’s easy to be lazy.

Fitness begins in daily choices—in the stairs we climb, the walks we take, the habits we build. It’s not confined to the gym. It lives in every step we choose to take.

Harsh Truths:
Money doesn’t change people—it reveals who they truly are.
If you're not fit, it's the result of your daily choices.
Most people don’t need therapy; they need discipline, sleep, and exercise.
Most people don’t want advice—they want sympathy for staying the same.


Serenity in Action:
As a society, we take everything too seriously—our studies, our work, even our families. We push ourselves to work harder and harder, and in doing so, we unknowingly invite stress and depression. Life isn’t meant to be a constant struggle. I’m not saying you should ignore important responsibilities—but approach them with ease, not pressure. Let life flow. Do what matters, but do it calmly.
— Dr. Ashwin Vijay


The Glass Wall:
From my room in the paying guest house, the world outside felt like a silent movie. My window was a single pane of glass: from my side, I could see everything. But for anyone on the outside, the same glass was a mirror. Just outside my window stood the elevator and a large water bottle used for refilling.

It was a place of brief pauses for people waiting for the elevator or after fetching water. People would adjust their hair, fix their collar, and check their smile in the window’s reflection—unaware that behind the mirrored surface, someone was watching.
It was a curious feeling. I began to think of a higher power as the silent observer behind the glass.

We act as if no one is watching, but every thought, every word, every choice we make is being observed—not for judgment, but simply because it’s part of the universe’s grand design.
Like me behind the glass—unseen yet ever-present—might there be watchers beyond our sight? Whether God, a colleague, a family member, or our own conscience, someone is always observing; there is no glass wall to hide behind.

Because in the end, it’s not about hiding—it’s about being someone worth seeing. 

The True Meaning of Respect:
True character shows up in how we treat everyone, no matter their job, their ideas, or how much we agree with them. Respect should never be pick-and-choose.

Just as you honor your boss, your parents, and your closest friends, you need to show that same respect to everyone else. This includes people whose opinions you disagree with or even people you see as rivals. Respecting others in every situation doesn't mean you're weak; it simply shows who you truly are.

If you only respect those who stand with you and dismiss those who don’t, you’ve misunderstood the essence of dignity. Real respect must be given freely, without checking for personal agreement or political alignment.

We must be mindful of the words we choose. While we often speak with respect and formality toward beloved leaders or loved ones—using titles like “Mr.” or “Ms.”—we may abandon that courtesy when addressing those we disagree with. Such unequal language doesn’t merely reveal bias; it reflects a deeper absence of fairness. 

When we let go of values like kindness, love, and respect, we hurt ourselves by allowing anger and hatred to grow within. By honoring everyone equally, we uplift others and demonstrate true strength and humility


Bhudha quotes: 
We are what we think. With our thoughts, we make the world.

Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly. 

Choose Your Hard:
Being poor is hard; getting rich is hard. 
Being underweight is hard; getting fit is hard.
Being married is hard; being single is hard.
Every choice in life is hard. Choose your hard—otherwise, your hard will choose you.


The one spy trick I would teach everyone to instantly improve their life is something called perception versus perspective. We all view the world through our own perception, which is our personal interpretation of the world around us. But perception is unique to each individual—and there's no inherent advantage in it. That’s why so many people find themselves constantly arguing, trying to convince others of their own perception.

The way to win any argument, advance in your career, outsell, or outperform anyone is to move beyond perception and into perspective. When you shift your viewpoint and step outside your own perception into someone else’s perspective, you begin to think like them. That gives you an information advantage.

Meanwhile, everyone else remains trapped in their own perception, not considering a different perspective. This instantly gives you superior insight, better positioning, and an edge they don’t have. If you apply this with your boss, it can transform your career. If you apply it with your spouse, it can transform your marriage. If you apply it with your children, it can transform your family legacy—because almost no one else is doing it.

- Andrew Bustamante.


Thoughts vs Thinking: 
You are not responsible for the thoughts and emotions that first appear in your mind.
But once you recognize them, how you respond is your responsibility.

Don’t try to control your thoughts — they come and go on their own.
What you can control is your thinking and actions: what you choose to focus on and do after the first thought.

For example, during tough times, you may feel hopeless or have negative thoughts. That is natural.
However, instead of dwelling on them, consider how to overcome the situation. The first thought is not in your control, but continuing with the same negative thinking is.

In fact, thoughts and emotions come to help you.
Fear or negative emotions warn you of danger. If you didn’t have them, you could be careless.
For example, if a poisonous snake enters your room, you will naturally feel fear and run away — this protects you.

So remember:

Thoughts will come and go. Emotions may rise suddenly.

But thinking and actions are always in your control.

If you’re angry and someone accidentally bumps into you from behind, your reaction depends on who it is.
If it’s a junior, you might shout. But if it’s a senior, a close friend, or your professor, your anger disappears quickly, and you might say, “I know, because of the huge crowd, you bumped into me by mistake.”
This shows that while your first emotion is automatic, your response and actions afterward are your choice.

– Sri Bagavath Ayya (Salem)


Important Laws: 
1. Murphy's Law:
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

2. Kidlin's Law:
If you can write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved.

3. Gilbert's Law:
The greatest fault in a piece of work is assuming that the other person knows what you want.

4. Falkland's Law
When you don't have to make a decision, don't make the decision.


Give the situation time to settle:
Moving from sunlight to shadow, or vice versa, causes a temporary inability to see clearly due to the eye’s light and dark adaptation—this offers a rich metaphor for life, learning, and growth.

- The uncomfortable flash of brightness or darkness is your system’s way of protecting you from harm. Overwhelm is simply a survival instinct.

- Encourage patience and optimism, like waiting for vision to clear or for code to run successfully.

- Just as the eyes need time to adjust from shadow to light, the heart needs time to adjust from struggles to peace. Be patient; clarity always comes.

Use it or lose it:
Unused money devalues. 
Unused talent diminishes. 
Unused potential decays. 
Unused machinery disintegrates. 
Unused time dies. 
Unused knowledge becomes a burden. 

What isn't used is abused. The tragedy of life isn't ultimate death, but the resources that die within you while you're still alive. Use it — or you will lose it.

Fear of judgment: 
You're not scared of being tested — you're afraid of being truly seen, of appearing vulnerable, and maybe not being accepted. But here's the truth: everyone is focused on themselves. They're not watching you the way you think they are.

As you push ahead, you'll realize nothing is holding you back except your own perception. And when you finally understand that no one was really judging you, you'll start doing the things you've always wanted to do. You'll become the person who once hid behind fear, thinking someone was watching.

Most people are too busy fighting their own battles. If you keep hiding, you'll never truly live. Many people merely exist — afraid to speak, move, or try. They're not judging you. You are.

The moment you stop caring, you win.


A Little More Than Before:

Learn a bit more than you knew before,
Open your mind, explore some more.
Work with heart, not just for score,
Let passion guide what’s at your core.

Smile a bit longer than yesterday,
Find small joys along the way.
Be gentler when the tempers roar,
Speak with kindness — a little more.

Still your fire, but guard its spark, 
Your dreams ignite when nights grow dark.
Rise each morning, ready to soar,
Not perfect — just a little more,
Than you were the day before.

The 48 Laws of Power (by Robert Greene)
Never outshine the master. (Always make those above you feel superior.)
Never put too much trust in friends; learn how to use enemies.
Conceal your intentions.
Always say less than necessary.
So much depends on reputation — guard it with your life.
Court attention at all costs.
Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.
Make other people come to you — use bait if necessary.
Win through your actions, never through argument.
Infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky.

Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.
When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest.
Pose as a friend, work as a spy.
Crush your enemy totally.
Use absence to increase respect and honor.
Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.
Do not build fortresses to protect yourself — isolation is dangerous.
Know who you’re dealing with — do not offend the wrong person.
Do not commit to anyone.
Play a sucker to catch a sucker — seem dumber than your mark.
Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power.
Concentrate your forces.
Play the perfect courtier.
Re-create yourself.
Keep your hands clean.
Play on people’s need to believe to create a cult-like following.
Enter action with boldness.
Plan all the way to the end.
Make your accomplishments seem effortless.

Master the art of timing.
Disdain things you cannot have — ignoring them is the best revenge.
Create compelling spectacles.
Think as you like but behave like others.
Stir up waters to catch fish.
Despise the free lunch.
Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes.
Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.
Work on the hearts and minds of others.
Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.
Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.
Never appear too perfect.
Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.
Assume formlessness. (Be adaptable; those who are rigid get broken.) 

Trust the Process, Even When Others Don’t:
Sometimes, when we do good but unconventional things for our growth, the people around us may not understand. They might think that because we’re doing things differently, we’re not in a good position — that we’re struggling or making mistakes.

This can apply to any area of life — financial, health, or personal. Only after we reach a better place will those around us understand why we chose this path. Until then, they may criticize us and urge us to follow the usual, familiar ways.

But growth rarely comes from comfort. Real progress often requires us to step away from the crowd, to face doubt, and to trust the unseen results of our efforts. The path may look uncertain now, but every challenge, every misunderstanding, and every moment of loneliness is shaping a stronger version of you.

One day, the same people who questioned your choices will admire your courage. So keep going — stay patient, stay consistent, and believe in the process. The struggle you face today will become the story of your strength tomorrow.
