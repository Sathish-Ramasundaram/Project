        <h1>TypeScript</h1>
        <p>TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.</p>
        <p>TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
            <br>
            This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
            <br><br>
            TypeScript being a Syntactic Superset means it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.</p>
